# Forecasting Energy Demand

This was my final project for Metis' Data Science Bootcamp. I built a regression model to forecast energy demand in New York State. The model was based off historical load data pulled from the New York State Independent Service Operator (NYISO), and weather data from Weather Underground.

`/notebooks` contains the exploratory analysis and instructions for how to download the data (which will save to folders in `\data`).

Why does forecasting matter?

Utilities need to be able to generate more capacity than the load placed on it. BUT generating electricity is expensive. You can't run all your generators all the time. You also can't fire up a boiler just as demand begins to spike. Some reactors are less responsive than others.

Being able to forecast energy load means utilities can create better models for when to ramp up capacity.
